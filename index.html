            <br>
            <br>
            This project aims to not only highlight the positive effects on A.I in the marketing sector but also shed light on how this invention may affect consumer behaviour, data protection, and consumers' purchasing intent and power.
            As the lead researcher on this project, my scope of study will be limited to Lagos, Nigeria and I will be employing the use of interviews and questionnaires to gather data.
            Results gotten from this research will assist marketers in employing the use of A.I in an ethical manner when creating marketing strategies.
